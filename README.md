# SOAR-EDR-Project

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

IMPORTANT SKILLS
Use of EDR
Creating detection from events that happened(installation of lazagne)

Create draw.io diagram
Create Vulture (VM)
Create LimaCharlie
Enroll vm in edr


system we joined to the edr

Go to github to install lazagne.exe

Limacharlie new process creation
Create detection from building off of new event

-Looking at events
-operators: and
And so on

You can even test your detection by pasting the event in the field and it will check is you detection works
How did you make the detection? Used an existing rule that was provided by limaCharlie for windows process creation credentidtials (with also the rule supplied on github) and modify it to fit my use case. Better to change an existing rule because you can follow the format and take a look at the field names that was used
proof of detection working
Create and ensure slack connects to limacharlie
Create Tines
Connect the two
